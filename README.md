# bae-zeus-x

## Description
Legend speaks of a man so unrealistically powerful and handsome that he is commonly likened to the Greek deity Zeus. 

Join Geoff Bae'Zeus on his vindictive conquest to grant the grace of superior technology to the unblessed peasants of the world as you protect him from the malicious intent of the 300th legion of Flying-Apple-Tossing-Monkey-Infantry commanded by the Benevolent Warlock of the East.

## Setup

It's really hard to do so, so it is not recommended.

Clone the repo, remove all Amazon APIs that require a keystore, then open and build in Unity.
